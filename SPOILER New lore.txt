Note2: For better specie appearance, some might be difficult to make a reason for such feature. 
I think I should be starting from evolutionary cause and find the way up to now.



GW new lore 

Galaxy 1
=========================================Ultaka T3-5 Invaders
Ultaka background:
Unknown origin, extremely powerful(Minimally Pug-tier but possibly more)
Most ships found are lower end of their warship made for mass production and raiding galaxies.
Roughly T3 as it is sufficient for most specie, higher end ships are available for stronger races.


Ultaka conquering galaxies for one of these reason:
Simply conquering.
Resource demanding civil war (potential to gain ally)
Above but against another specie (cliche?)

Ship Series:
Standard T3
Mega T4
Neurn T3 wep, special ships
Lvoris T5


=========================================Wallagi T3 Native
Background:
(To be) The frontline of Galaxy 1 against the Ultaka. Previously will only watch and record the history 
of the galaxy and poke around slightly to prevent extinction but will not interfere directly (with their own navy)
unless it is absolutely necessary(Like Ultaka invasion).



=========================================Revos T3(?) Native
Isolationist, prefer not to mess with other races and only mind their own buisness. Will only watch the events from afar.

Specie detail:
Much smaller than an average human with most averages around 40-50cm, their tallest being roughly 60cm tall.

Ship details:
Highly advanced in defense technology but will not work at larger ship scale. (Not possible with game mechanic yet)

=========================================Donko T2.5-3 Native
Very systematic, perfer to name things with numbers and letters, some will have codenames(like ships).

Specie detail:
Currently described as ape-like with slightly long white fur/hair. Can comfortably walk on 2 or 4.

Ship detail:
Tanky-crystalline ships based on unique crystal found in systems they own. 

=========================================Qoro T2
Currently split into two fraction, northern and eastern. Rivality history traces back since their "middle age", both fraction are
slightly different visually but still anatomically mostly the same.

Specie detail
Physically weaker but more flexible than human, slightly smaller on average but all four limbs have hands and can walk on either 2 or 4.
Most prefer to walk on all 4, can be flipped and walk upside-down without difficulty.
=========================================Dels T1 Native
