#Ignaggen will have two series of ships; first, rocky, cockpitless ships, with crystal sensor around the ship designed and made with technology before Dels contact
#made with unique technologies allowing very durable ships but are much more delicate and very difficult to manufacture.
#second a more modern design incorperating technologies introduced by Dels allowing faster production at cost of durability not matching ships made with their
#original technology. Nonetheless sufficient for most uses by Ignaggen.

#As civillians move to cheaper ships made with new manufacturing methods, the military remains using the original technology for durability and reliablity.

#Ignaggen space exploration and colonization procedure; 
# Scouts jumps into the system and systems surrounding it several time to collect various data about the system and what's in it.
# A fleet is prepared for colonizing according to the data usually involve around 20-50 warships as guard and numerous other civilian ships. Scouts awaits at destination.
# The whole fleet jumps together to the destination.
