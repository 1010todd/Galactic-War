For his case he helped defended many frontier planets against Kroom raids as well as multiple preemptive strike against the Kroom to prevent such raids before the government noticed him and allowed him to buy one the more advanced techs. He explained that he wasn't really aware of this policy at first and was doing it on his own because he was born in one of the world that was constantly raided and have first hand experience dealing with it and he doesn't want that to happen again.`

			`	He said he just didn't thought of it, he just happens to find a Kroom warship crash landed in decent condition one day so after some repairs and figuring out he joined the local defense fleet with the refurbished Kroom warship. Though that was during the days where the Kroom are still focused on just the Geeva and they -the Geeva- was still setting up their military infrastructure and did not have enough ships and supplies to completely blockade the frontlines, while the Geeva ships were better they could keep up with what seems like endless swarm of Kroom ships. Now that their navy is much more structed and stable along with the Kroom getting caught up in other fronts they could hold the front on their own now, but any extra help is still appreciated.`
