conversation "GW Dels Start 1"
	`After years of preparation, you finally got called for your request to transfer into a free officer, where you are allowed to have more freedom choosing how to operate and choosing your own route within the laws and regulation. You arrived at the head of personnel management's office right on time. With a silent whoosh the automatic door slid open before you as you enter the room feeling the change in atmosphere reminding you of the first time you applied to be an officer...`
	`	"So you want to become a free officer." the man says as he leans back on his chair, eyes locked to the monitor. "I'll remind you again, with more freedom comes with greater responsibility. You will report activity every week, get your ship condition check as your engineer suggest, and report in immediately if you're called.". "Yes." You said in agreement. "Please scan your hand on the screen if you're aware and agree to your new terms." he taps his side of the screen a few times.`
	`	The screen facing you turns on displaying a blue circle with a label "Hand here.". You did as instructed. The circle slowly shifts to red and beeped twice displaying your name on the screen....`
	name
	`"Congratulations, Captain <first>. From this second on you're officially a free officer of the Kaote Navy. From now on you're free to own and operate your own ship and go your own way." He says glacing at you for a second before going back to his monitor.`
	`	You tapped your tail on the floor three times to signal him that you're leaving. He knocked the table rapidly three times acknowledging and confirming it is done.`
	`	Leaving the head of personnel management office relived. The procedure was surprisngly fast for such a change in role, compared to the time you spent preparing and getting qualifications in the past years.`

			`	You eventually touch down on an empty landing pad and have a break taking a look at all the features of the ship. You noted that the star map is empty, perhaps you can try to key in some system you noted down from your time working in the bridge of a carrier, or you start fresh and explore the unknown again now on your own.`
