	description "Primary weapon for Zis assault infrantry, AC-30 is pretty heavy compared to the laser rifle, but way more effective for boarding because with its feature including a built-in grenade launcher, adjustable rate of fire, safe, semi-auto, 2 shot burst, 3 shot burst, 5 shot burst and full auto firing mode, adjustable scope that can also flip out if not required and a bayonet port. Even though it got alot of feature but its quite easy to master."
